//Abs: we create abstract class using abstract keyword 
//In abs class, normal and abs methods 
//cant acheive 100% abstraction
//abs class cannot support miltiple inheritanve . because it is a class 


//Interface: we used interface as file name to create a new interface 
//all methods are abstract (no method body)
//acheive 100% abstraction in interface, becaus eonly abs methods are created 
//acheive multiple inheritance
